NAME

    Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles - XT::Files interface for Test::PerlTidy

VERSION

    Version 0.001

SYNOPSIS

        use Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles;
        Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles->new->all_files_ok;

DESCRIPTION

    Adds support for the XT::Files interface to Test::PerlTidy.

USAGE

 new( [ ARGS ] )

    Returns a new Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles instance. new takes an optional
    hash or list with its arguments.

        Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles->new(
            mute => 1,
            perltidyrc => 'the_perltidyrc_file_to_use',
        );

    The following arguments are supported:

  mute (optional)

    By default, Test::PerlTidy will output diagnostics about any errors
    reported by perltidy, as well as any actual differences found between
    the pre-tidied and post-tidied files. Set mute to a true value to turn
    off that diagnostic output.

    Internally, we set the localized $Test::PerlTidy::MUTE package
    variable, depending on this value.

  perltidyrc (optional)

    The perltidy argument can be used to specify a specific .perltidyrc
    config file.

 all_files_ok

    Calls the all_perl_files method of Test::XTFiles to get all the files
    to be tested. All files will be checked by calling is_file_tidy from
    Test::PerlTidy.

    It calls done_testing or skip_all so you can't have already called
    plan.

    all_files_ok returns something true if all files test ok and false
    otherwise.

    Please see XT::Files for how to configure the files to be checked.

EXAMPLES

 Example 1 Default usage

    Check all the files returned by XT::Files with Test::PerlTidy.

        use 5.006;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles;

        Test::PerlTidy::XTFiles->new->all_files_ok;

 Example 2 Check non-default directories or files

    Use the same test file as in Example 1 and create a .xtfilesrc config
    file in the root directory of your distribution.

        [Dirs]
        module = lib
        module = tools
        module = corpus/hello

        [Files]
        module = corpus/world.pm
